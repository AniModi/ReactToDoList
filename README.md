# TODO LIST

A simple TODO list made as a beginner project while learning the react library. If I stop updating this basic project, I might have started a different project or got bored from this particular project. The asthetics of the projects are really bad (I know this), but my asthetic sense is not that great ðŸ¥². 

# Features

It is currently a simple react app. It supports addition and removal of tasks, the tasks are stored in local storage and it also supports filtering tasks on basis of year.
